1. generate board
2. input swap
3. check swap and remember matching patterns
4. if match: move sprites in table. else: reset board
5. trigger matched cells.ondestroy? 
6. trigger adjacent tile effects (ex: explosion next to a box breaks the box)
7. apply gravity to board
	a. for each cell starting from the bottom, check if it's empty and pull the pill above to itself? 
	b. create a PillGravityEvent for this
	c. animate gravity on sprite2ds
	d. wait for animation to be done for all pills
	//e. update position of pills in the board table and node table
8. generate new pills in empty cells
	a. check for deadlock and generate again if necessary
	b. animate gravity on new sprite2ds
11. check matches on the newly generated pills
12. trigger matched cells.ondestroy
